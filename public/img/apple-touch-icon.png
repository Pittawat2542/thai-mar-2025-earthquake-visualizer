This file should be a 180x180 pixel PNG version of the favicon.svg, optimized for Apple devices.

The image should maintain the same design as the SVG favicon:
- Blue gradient background (#1a56db to #3b82f6)
- Circular design with white epicenter
- Concentric seismic wave circles
- Earthquake zigzag line in the center

This image will be used as the home screen icon when users add the website to their home screen on iOS devices.
