This file should be a 512x512 pixel PNG designed specifically as a maskable icon.

Key features:
- Blue gradient background (#1a56db to #3b82f6) that extends to the full square
- The main earthquake design elements should be contained within the "safe zone" (centered 80% of the image)
- Seismic wave circles and epicenter centered in the image
- Earthquake zigzag line in the center
- No important visual elements in the outer 10% of each edge

This icon is specifically optimized for Android devices that use adaptive icons, which may crop the image into different shapes (circle, square, rounded square, etc.).
